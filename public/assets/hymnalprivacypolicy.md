# Privacy Policy

This policy applies to all information collected or submitted on the Hymnal app for iOS.

## Information we collect

We do not collect any of your information. Nothing. Nada.

## Security

We implement a variety of security measures to help keep your information secure. For instance, all communication with the app and website requires HTTPS with certificate pinning.

## Accessing, changing, or deleting your information

Since we do not collect or store any of your information, this does not apply.

## California Online Privacy Protection Act Compliance

We comply with the California Online Privacy Protection Act. We therefore will not distribute your personal information to outside parties without your consent.

## Childrenâ€™s Online Privacy Protection Act Compliance

We never collect or maintain information at our website from those we actually know are under 13, and no part of our app is structured to attract anyone under 13.

## Information for European Union Customers

By using Hymnal and providing your information, you authorize us to collect, use, and store your information outside of the European Union. However, as we do not collect, store, or use any of your information, this is a moot point.

## International Transfers of Information

Information may be processed, stored, and used outside of the country in which you are located. Data privacy laws vary across jurisdictions, and different laws may be applicable to your data depending on where it is processed, stored, or used. But again, we do not collect, store, or use any of your information.

## Your Consent

By using our app, you consent to our privacy policy.

## Contacting Us

If you have questions regarding this privacy policy, you may email jacob@marttinen.ca.

## Changes to this policy

If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes on this page. Summary of changes so far:
